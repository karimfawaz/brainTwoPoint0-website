        text: "In 2019, Brain 2.0 launched its first E-Commerce Web-Store. OneInStock's purpose was making the customer's shopping experience as enjoyable as possible on a fluid interface using a custom-built e-commerce website: www.oneinstock.me (currently not available). The project was intended to impact the Lebanese market. In Lebanon, most online stores charge a very high commission for their stock. Brain 2.0 wanted to make the e-commerce sector a more competitive field by offering limited edition items on a high-end website for a very cheap price which would force other stores to offer better prices. We also offered free gifts with each order along with a handwritten thank you letter to build a connection with our customers. The store only had 1 item in stock which helped the user make faster decisions. On several occasions, we had two or more customers enquiring about the same item and because some of the customers missed out on one item they would buy another one very quickly to not miss out again. Due to unfortunate circumstances, Lebanon started its worst economic crisis in October 2019, 1 month after the website's launch. In January 2020, Lebanese banks blocked transactions using foreign currencies which meant we could not fund the hosting of OneInStock.me and had to revert to an Instagram-based store. From October until December 2019, we were recruiting Instagram-based stores to give them a free platform to advertise their products on OneInStock.me, we had Keto food stores, customized jewlery, customized phone cases, and customized socks ready to join the OneInStock.me ecosystem but due to the Lebanese banks' measures, the operation was halted. OneInStock still operates as an Instagram Store. When the economic situation improves in Lebanon we would look forward to resuming our platform project in Lebanon and hopefully expand our reach around the world.",
